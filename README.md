# Databricks and Azure Blob Storage
A Project which includes generating test data, transfering dataframes to different file formats and storing the files to Azure Blob Storage.

Project Steps:

1. Generate test data which resembles sensor data. Two datasets were created, one resembling data collected from sensors and one illustrating metadata.
2. Dataframes were changed to different datatypes (Avro, Parquet, ORC and Delta Lake).
3. Dataframes notebook was mounted to Azure Blob Storage by using security token. 
4. Files were written to Blob Storage.
5. Files were read from Blob Storage.
